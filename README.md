# bright-test

## Description
We will be creating a game similar to bejeweled or candy crush. You will have to create a react app that displays a 5*5 grid. When a user clicks on a square, it will check all squares adjacent to it that have the same color and "pop" those squares. Once those squares have been popped, squares on top of any that were popped should fall to the lowest possible position.

### Notes
* Only squares that are directly adjacent to the clicked square need to be popped
* Adjacent is only up, down, left, right. Not diagonal
